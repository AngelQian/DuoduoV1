The project is implemented mainly with JAVA BOOT, JPA, Hibernate, ORM, Security and REST technology. The database is using Mysql currently.
The web page will be used with HTML, CSS and AngularJS.

------------------------

The project process:
1. set up database (Mysql)
2. set up IntelliJ, connect with Database
3. Research Hibernate as an engine, JPA access data to database
4. // Implement Restful APIs for processing data
5. // Construct web pages with HTML, CSS and AngularJS
6. // deploy the project to cloud service

Surely, I encountered lots of errors while coding. My most impressive ones are as following:
1. initiate error
REASON: the project may contains multiple versions of an resource, some of them were loaded in library, others are injected as dependencies
SOLUTION: check the duplicate libraries, I recommend remove the old version.
2. weired error
REASON: the Class's dependency is not the correct one in the project. 
SOLUTION: figure out the Class and replace with similar class, try again.
